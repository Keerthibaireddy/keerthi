Wine Quality Prediction

Introduction and Overview
The various chemical components in wine give the wine its distinct taste and aroma. Appreciation of wine quality involves moving beyond our innate preferences.
These physicochemical properties can be used to model wine quality. The price of wine depends on a rather abstract concept of wine appreciation by wine tasters, 
opinion among whom may have a high degree of variability. Pricing of wine depends on such a volatile factor to some extent.

Our objective is in this project is to create a Machine Learning models that can predict the quality of the wine with the help of the chemical properties involved
in it.

Business Objective:

Our target is to predict the target variable "Quality" based on its ranking on performing classification models.
